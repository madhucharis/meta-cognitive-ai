What are the different types of questions?

There are many different ways to classify or categorize questions, but here are some common types:

Open-ended questions: These are questions that allow for a wide range of answers and encourage discussion and elaboration. Examples include "What do you think about...?" or "How do you feel about...?"

Closed-ended questions: These are questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no" or a specific piece of information. Examples include "Do you like...?" or "What is your name?"

Fact-based questions: These are questions that require a specific piece of information or knowledge. Examples include "What is the capital of France?" or "What year did World War II start?"

Opinion-based questions: These are questions that ask for someone's thoughts, feelings, or beliefs on a particular topic. Examples include "What do you think is the best way to...?" or "How do you feel about...?"

Probing questions: These are questions that are designed to get more information or to clarify something. Examples include "Can you explain that in more detail?" or "What do you mean by...?"

Hypothetical questions: These are questions that ask what someone would do or think in a particular situation. Examples include "What would

you do if you won the lottery?" or "How do you think you would react if...?"

Rhetorical questions: These are questions that are asked for effect, but not intended to be answered. Examples include "Isn't it a beautiful day?" or "Do you really think I would do that?"

Leading questions: These are questions that are designed to suggest a particular answer or point of view. Examples include "Don't you think...?" or "Isn't it true that...?"

Multiple-choice questions: These are questions that provide a set of options for the answer, typically with one correct option and several incorrect options.

Binary questions: These are questions that only have two possible answers, often "yes" or "no". Examples include "Are you coming with us?" or "Do you want to eat pizza?"
