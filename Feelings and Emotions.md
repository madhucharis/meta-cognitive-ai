what is the difference between feelings and emotions

Feelings and emotions are related concepts, but there is a difference between the two.

Emotions refer to a complex psychological and physiological state that includes a subjective experience, expressive behaviors, and physiological responses. Emotions are often short-lived and may be triggered by a specific event or situation. Emotions can be considered as basic human responses to the environment and can include happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust.

Feelings, on the other hand, are the conscious experience of emotional states. They are the subjective experience of emotions and can vary in intensity and duration. Feelings can be influenced by emotions but may also be influenced by other factors such as personal beliefs, memories, and cultural norms. Feelings can be expressed through language, behavior, and other means of communication.

To summarize, emotions are the automatic response of the body to a specific stimulus or situation, while feelings are the subjective experience of those emotions.
